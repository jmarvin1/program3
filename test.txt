Is this the real life is this just fantasy caught in a landslide no escape from
reality. Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see. I'm just a poor I need no
sympathy. Because I'm easy come easy go. Little high little low. Anyway the wind blows
doesnt really matter to me, to me.
Momma just killed a man. Put a gun against his head. Pulled my trigger nows he's 
dead. Momma life had just begun. But now I've gone and thrown it all away. Momma
ooooooh didn't mean to make you cry. If I'm not back again this time tomorrow.
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters. Too late, my time has come. Send 
shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time. Goodbye everybody, I've got to go.
Gotta leave it all behind and faaaace the truth. Momma, I don't wanna die. 
Sometimes wish never been born at all
